# 3D Scan Completion using Deep Learning and Point Cloud Reconstruction

## Abstract

The introduction of 3D scanning technology has advanced deep learning frameworks for enhancing scan completeness by creatively recreating missing regions in raw scans. While promising on synthetic data, real-world application requires matched datasets containing both completed and incomplete scans, posing a significant challenge.

## Approach

This project leverages the ShapeNet and KITTI datasets with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and PointNet++, employing data-driven and unsupervised learning architectures for reconstructing accurate point cloud structures. These frameworks address the complexities of 3D geometric data representation and image completion.

## Results

Experiments on the KITTI and ShapeNet datasets demonstrate our network achieving an accuracy of approximately 86%, with reduced computational complexity and cost, facilitating practical deployment.
